WEBDEV THOUGHTS

validation:
	- phone numbers
	- email addrs
	- street addrs

Keep code clean (no print statements)

CONSISTENCY in REST URLs

Use PK to reference objects rather than mongo _id.

Logic jumbled in controllers.

Download mongoose-simple-random.

We need a nav bar

Invert contact events (currently starts with oldest)

Error Checking

Pagination increments forever

The homepage issue - Users login

Consider templating some html

Finish async calls

Chicken and egg problem with login

Rules 1 works (maybe a better implementation)



get customer
get contact history
check if date - last contact date = 72 hrs
if true
	randomly assign new agent
		change customers agentID
else
	page = error
